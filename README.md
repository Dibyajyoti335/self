# Used CNN model to count the number of fingers using 21600 Greyscale images from Fingers dataset on Kaggle
# Implemented optimization techniques like Adam optimizer, dropouts, and regularization methods to prevent overfitting
# Fit the CNN models on the train data for 10 epochs and validation split of 0.1 to achieve an overall accuracy of 99%
